# College-Football-Simulator

I conducted the analysis in this repository as part of two courses, STAT 4996: Capstone and STAT 4800: Advanced Sports Analytics. The data analyzed includes over 100 variables describing every play that took place in the 2019 NCAA College Football season.

In the first course, my group sought to understand when a team should transition from a conservative to aggressive offensive playing strategy, depending on a number of game conditions including down, field position and score differential.
In the second course, my continued to build on this foundation to assess when it is beneficial to go for it on 4th down rather than kicking a field goal.

The analysis techniques we leveraged include distribution fitting, markov chains, monte carlo simulations, and logistic regression, and all programming was done in R. 

Included in this repository are the final deliverables for each of these courses, as well as the scripts used for data exploration and visualization, distribution fitting and simulations.
